This project base on functions.
Three type of objects were built in this project:
> Monum

> Polynomial

> Complex functions.

 Each object is a type of function.

The monom structure: ax ^ b.
A polynomial is built from a collection of monomies
A complex function consists of 2 functions that are polynomial (left, right) and action.
You can build the objects using a string or create a new object.
You can perform several mathematical operations on any object, for example:
Find a root in a particular stator
> -Add

> -multiply

> -using Riemann's integral

and also
> -Copy objects

> -write a string of the object

In addition to this project can create a graph print of the complex functions
